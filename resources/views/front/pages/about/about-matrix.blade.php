            Hundreds of students from nearby districts such as Sikar, Churu, Jhunjhunu, Bikaner, Alwar, Hanumangarh, Sri Ganganagar, Nagaur, Jaipur etc. who had enrolled in foundation programs at Kota/Jaipur etc. have come back to Matrix to
            realize that what Matrix has to offer in terms of JEE &amp; NEET preparation is significantly better than any other institute in the country. What more, an increasing number of students from northern Haryana, Punjab and UP have
            also started choosing Matrix for their NEET &amp; JEE preparation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the sheer hard work of the core team Mr. Anil Gora (B.Tech, IIT Kharagpur 2009), Mr. Kapil Singh Dhaka (B.Tech, IIT Kharagpur 2009, MBA, IIM Ahmadabad 2012), Mr. Narendra Kok (B.Tech, IIT Kharagpur, 2010), Mr. Rajendra
            Burdak (B.Tech SIST University 2008) and Mr. Anupam Agrawal (B.Tech, IIT Kanpur) as well as numerous faculty members who themselves are graduates from top IITs, IIMs, NITs and Medical colleges of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have been able to successfully change the discourse of coaching in Sikar. We have set new standards in terms of Teaching Methodology, Faculty Quality, Study Material Quality and Personal Care. We believe that our stupendous
            growth in last 5 years is a testament to our quality and changing belief of students and teachers. Though we started with just 3 teachers in 2013, as of March 2019, we have a team of 100+ faculty members with ~35 of them from
            prestigious IITs, NITs and reputed medical colleges
        </p>

        <p>Not just the quality of faculty at Matrix is excellent; Matrix also offers a commitment to personally care for students.</p>
        <p>
            As an institute, Matrix has never compared itself with others. We sincerely believe that there is simply no comparison between Matrix and other institutes. We work hard every day to ensure that Matrix of today is a better
            version of Matrix of yesterday. And this has been our most important success mantra till date. Over the last three years, we have helped more than 500 students to secure admissions in top departments at prestigious IITs and
            NITs. Highest success rate in JEE advanced with class 12th, highest JEE score, most no. of students with highest JEE Main across many subjects, maximum JEE advanced selection etc. are few of the records that we have broken in
            last five years only.
        </p>

        <p>With a razor sharp focus on NEET preparation, MATRIX hopes to re-create the magic of JEE preparation for NEET students in years to come.</p>
        <p>We hope you can also benefit from what Matrix has to offer. We also wish you all the best for your future and hope that you realize all your dreams.</p>

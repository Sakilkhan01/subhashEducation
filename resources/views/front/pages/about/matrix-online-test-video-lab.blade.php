                            <p>Everyone knows the advantage of online test and with technology online test is preferred over the offline test. If students prepare for a particular topic they can give tests as per their choice and analyze their level of performance. Online tests and their results help teachers to know the weak and strong areas of students. With this, Matrix Faculties assist students to work on both strong and weak points to perform better. Students themselves can observe their performance by analyzing how much time they spend on particular questions or on which topic they can score good, etc. The major factor behind using online test series is that JEE Main, JEE Advanced and NEET both are conducted in Online Mode.

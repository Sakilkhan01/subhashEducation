                            "MATRIX proved to a good institute for me. It plays a great role in getting me to IIT Delhi. Here are the things which I loved about matrix - <br />
                            1. The way of teaching and doubt solving of teachers is pretty good.<br />
                            2. Study material.<br />
                            3. Teachers told us the way to do homework and way to attempt paper so that we can use knowledge effectively.<br />
                            4. Teachers also motivated class regularly so that we can't lose our track of study.<br />
                            5. Regular checking of homework.<br />
                            6. Finally, they helped me a lot in choosing the right college based on my JEE rank.<br />

                            "My time at Matrix JEE Academy has been through knowledge, skill, competition, interactions with one of the wisest persons of my life and above all a great experience that made me worthy of getting into IIT. I
                            had my best ever student-teacher interactions with KSD sir, AG sir, and NK sir. Their backup against any problem provided me with confidence and motivation to chase the much difficult IIT dream. They do work so
                            hard on our academics that I used to feel guilty whenever I would have not synchronized to their extent of labor. The thing I miss here at IIT is that I could get my doubts solved whenever I wanted at coaching,
                            any time! Thanks to Matrix, I got to make friends with the smartest students who have been with me ever since.”

                            (which was so low in 11th that even after getting first rank in a few tests I could not overcome it).But in 12th I used to think that our teachers were working so hard for us and they were more serious about our
                            studies which provided me tremendous motivation. As a result I did things either this way or the other way (aar ya paar). Along with it I worked on improving my concentration which I ultimately did by paying all
                            my attention to the teacher in the class and I found that when you do so you are able to clear your doubts yourself (because the teachers taught everything so nicely that there is nothing left). There are many
                            other things but I would just like to say that it was all that cannot be forgotten.”

                            the subjects and the paper of jee. In middle of my journey i was a bit displaced from my path but with motivation from Anil gora sir and Kapil sir i was able to come back on my path. At last i want to just say
                            that Matrix provided me the best environment i would have got. So thanks Matrix!!”

                            success behind coaching system of Matrix, supplemented by amazing quality (and quantity too) study material, and a dedicated and supportive team of teachers all together helped me to boost up my skills in
                            subjects. Another appreciable thing that I personally felt is maintaining a good interaction among teachers and students inspite of having such a big strength of learners. Quality of questions in the practice
                            paper was like awesome. I dint feel much difference in giving jee exam from my coaching tests. All and whole. It was an awesome experience preparing for jee with the help of Matrix institute.”

                            "I have attended sir's lectures for two years while i was preparing for iit jee in kota. i can definitely say he uses simple and direct speech to teach us and put all the concepts in our mind clearly. he has
                            always helped me with doubts, any question asked was answered and explained by him as many times as i needed to understand. not only the mathematics part but also he motivated all his students and encouraged all
                            of us during our two year preparation. he gives his own example to encourage us and thats why he has been an amazing inspiration to me and i'm sure to other students as well. i am thankful to him for his
                            contribution in whatever i am today and whatever i will be in future.”
